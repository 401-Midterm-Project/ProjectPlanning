## SCOPE IN/OUT

### IN - What will our project do?

* The web app will provide all users information about local daycares that they might have an interest in

* The web app will allow a user to be distinguished between a parent and a daycare provider when logging in/creating a user account

* The web app will allow users to create a username and access different parts of the application depending on what type of user they are (parent vs provider)

* The web app will show the parent users information about the different daycares, what they might offer/not offer and allow them to search by the different daycare amenities

* The web app will allow daycare providers the ability to add their daycare to the app so that parent users can then search for the daycare

### OUT - What will our project NOT do?

* Our app will not offer an application process for different daycares

* Our app will not offer an option for the user to review different daycares

## Non-Functional Requirements

1) Security - the security on the site would be defined by the roles so that the parent and the daycare can only add/modify their own information
2) Testability - we will be able to test the routes of our site through Swagger and that the migrations are logging/saving our data as we had anticipated
