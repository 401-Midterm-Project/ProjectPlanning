> * I want to develop the Craft competency further.
> * I plan to approach the day-to-day work doing the best I can with the card that I checkout and ensuring that I do not bite off more than I can chew or lose sight of what we agreed was the minimum viable product.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

> If/when conflicts arise, we will be direct and mindful in communicating with each other. If we are not able to figure it out amongst ourselves, we will involve help from Keith, Craig and/or Stacey.

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

> * Use Slack as needed.
> * Be in classroom as needed through lunches if available.
> * Prioritize main functionality of site before stretch goals & design.

Ian -
> In person every day 9a - 5p; with flexible outside hours as needed.  

Yvette -
> Online for normal lecture time and then in person for normal lab time.  Online afterwards.
> Updated 12/06/2021 - I will be in from about 9:15/9:30am to 4:30/5:00pm and then working from home after that

Jaren -
> In person every day

Misti -
> In person every day as much as possible during project week.

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

> * Utilize Trello to break d/Github pages own tasks into small, manageable chunks.
> * Take ownership of task/feature you feel confident working on, but be mindful of time-boxing and speaking up when struggling for too long.
> * Try Pair-Programming when stuck on a feature.
