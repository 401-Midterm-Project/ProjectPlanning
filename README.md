>Yvette - My strengths are organization and time-management for deadlines.  I can help remind myself and the team when items are due for our project to make sure we hit those key dates.  I want to develop the Craft Competency further.  I plan to approach the day-to-day work doing the best I can with the card that I checkout and ensuring that I do not bite off more than I can chew or lose sight of what we agreed was the minimum viable product.


##  Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

>If/when conflicts arise, we will be direct and mindful in communicating with each other. If we are not able to figure it out amongst ourselves, we will involve help from Keith, Craig and/or Stacey.


Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

>Ian - in person every day 9a - 5p; with flexible outside hours as needed.  
>
>Yvette-online for normal lecture time and then in person for normal lab time.  Online afterwards.
>>
>Jaren - in person every day
>>
>>Misty - in person every day
>
>Use Slack as needed.
>
>Be in classroom as needed through lunches if available.

>Prioritize main functionality of site before stretch goals & design.

##  Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

>Utilize Trello to break d/Github pages own tasks into small, manageable chunks.
>
>Take ownership of task/feature you feel confident working on, but be mindful of time-boxing and speaking up when struggling for too long.
>
>Try Pair-Programming when stuck on a feature.

##  Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.
